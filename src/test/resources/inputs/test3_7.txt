// Test 3.7
// T1 should not abort because site 4 did not fail.
// In this case, T1 will write to x4 on every site.
// x8 will not value 88 because T2 aborts
// the correct value right away but must wait for a write to take place.
// So W(T2,x8,88)
// will not commit and is lost on failure.
// Even though site 2 recovers before T2, T2 will not retroactively
// write to the site (in any practical version of available copies).
// T2 aborts because it wrote to x8.
