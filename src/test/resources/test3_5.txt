// Test 3.5
// T1 should not abort because site 4 did not fail.
// However T1 will write to x4 on every site except site 2.
// Site 2 should not be able to respond to read requests for any
// replicated variable after it recovers until a write is committed to it.
// T1's write will not go to site 2, so every site except site 2
// will have x4 equal to 91
// T2
// will not commit and W(T2,x8,88) is lost on failure.
// Therefore x8 will not have value 88 because T2 aborts.
// Even though site 2 recovers before T2 ends, T2 will not retroactively
// write to the site (in any practical version of available copies).
